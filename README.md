eCommerce website to facilitate the secure uploading and sale of music tracks.

This site was made as part of my 4th year on the University of Dundee's Applied Computing course. It allows bands to upload songs and standard users to add tracks to a cart and buy through paypal. All user details are handled securely, passwords are encrypted and salted and roles and rights are assigned on a per-user basis. On top of this https is applied throughout. All of this works to ensure that there is theft or malicious entry of information.

The application can be found on heroku: https://vast-anchorage-2595.herokuapp.com/

As this is coursework there are still some minor bugs that need ironed out.

The Amazon S3 account associated with the site has been shut down.
